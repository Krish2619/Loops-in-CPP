AIM:
To understand and implement various fundamental programming concepts in C++ including loops, conditional statements, nested loops, pattern printing, number sequences, and simple string comparison.

APPARATUS:
1. Computer with C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)
2. Code editor or IDE

PROGRAM EXPLANATION:
The provided set of programs demonstrates fundamental concepts of programming in C++ such as iterating through loops, conditional checking, using nested loops to print patterns, controlling loop execution flow with continue statements, and basic string manipulation for password verification. The programs include printing even numbers, repetition of strings, printing odd numbers using loop control, multiple star (*) patterns with increasing and decreasing counts, pyramid patterns, number pyramids, printing a continuous sequence of numbers, and a simple password validation program.

ALGORITHMS:

Algorithm 1: Print even numbers from 1 to 10
1. Start
2. For i from 1 to 10 do:
   a. If i is divisible by 2 (i % 2 == 0)
   i. Print i
3. End

Algorithm 2: Print "Symbiosis" 5 times with numbering
1. Start
2. For i from 0 to 4 do:
   a. Print (i+1).Symbiosis
3. End

Algorithm 3: Print odd numbers less than 10 using continue
1. Start
2. For i from 1 to 9 do:
   a. If i is even, skip the iteration (continue)
   b. Else print i
3. End

Algorithm 4: Print half pyramid of stars increasing from 1 to 6 rows
1. Start
2. For i from 1 to 6 do:
   a. For j from 1 to i do:
   i. Print "* "
   b. Print newline
3. End

Algorithm 5: Print inverted half pyramid of stars from 6 to 1 rows
1. Start
2. For i from 6 down to 1 do:
   a. For j from 1 to i do:
   i. Print "* "
   b. Print newline
3. End

Algorithm 6: Print right-aligned half pyramid of stars with 6 rows
1. Start
2. For i from 1 to 6 do:
   a. Print (6 - i) spaces
   b. Print i stars with spaces
   c. Print newline
3. End

Algorithm 7: Print inverted right-aligned half pyramid of stars with 6 rows
1. Start
2. For i from 6 down to 1 do:
    a. Print (i + 1) spaces
    b. Print (6 - i + 1) stars with spaces
    c. Print newline
3. End

Algorithm 8: Print Floyd’s triangle with numbers up to 10
1. Start
2. Initialize variable a = 1
3. For i from 0 to 3 do:
    a. For j from 0 to i do:
    i. Print a and increment a by 1
    b. Print newline
4.End

Algorithm 9: Print numbers from 1 to 20
1. Start
2. For i from 1 to 20 do:
   a. Print i
3. End

Algorithm 10: Simple password check
1. Start
2. Define password string pass = "hi123"
3. Input string in from user
4. If length of in is not equal to length of pass, print "The password is wrong" and end
5. Else, for each character position i from 0 to length of pass - 1:
  a. If pass[i] is not equal to in[i], print "The password is wrong" and end
6. If all characters match, print "The password is correct"
7. End

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Loops: for loops to iterate through sequences or rows.
- Conditional Statements: if, else, and continue for flow control.
- Nested Loops: For creating patterns in multiple dimensions (rows and columns).
- string Handling: Comparing two strings character by character.
- Output Formatting: Using spacing and new lines to format outputs correctly.
- Increment Operators: Using ++ to increment counters and variables.

CONCLUSION:
These programs collectively illustrate the fundamental programming constructs in C++ such as loops, conditionals, nested loops, and string manipulation, which are essential building blocks for writing more complex programs. Understanding these concepts aids in solving a variety of problems, including pattern generation, sequence printing, and basic validation tasks. Mastery of these basics will serve as a solid foundation for further studies in programming and software development.
